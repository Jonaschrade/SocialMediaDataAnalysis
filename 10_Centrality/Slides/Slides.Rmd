# The concept of centrality

Social network analysis can be used to measure the importance of a person as a function of the social structure of a community or organization. 

In social networks, **centrality** measures this kind of structural importance of the node of a person. There are various centrality measures that stem from different kinds of structural importance. 

Today you will learn about four centrality measures:

1. Degree centrality
2. Betweenness centrality
3. Closeness centrality
4. Coreness centrality

---

# Degree centrality

<div style="float:right">
<img src="networkDirected.png" alt="Network example." width=400px/>  
</div>

A node's **degree centrality** measures the number of links connected to it. 

In directed networks:
- **in-degree** $d_{in}(i)$ that is the number of edges ending in $i$, i.e. $(j,i)$ 
- **out-degree** $d_{out}(i)$ that is the number of edges leaving from $i$, i.e. $(i,j)$

$d_{in}(c) = 1$ and $d_{out}(c) = 2$

If importance on Twitter is the number of followers of an account, in-degree centrality is a way to measure it.
---

# Betweenness Centrality

<div style="float:right">
<img src="undirNetworkBtw.png" alt="Network betweenness example." width=400px/>  
</div>

Sometimes the importance of a person is quantified as the number of shortest paths between two other people that pass through this person. In this case, **betweenness** centrality measures importance:
$$C_B(i) = \sum_{s \neq i, t \neq i} n_i(s,t)$$

Where $n_i(s,t)$ is the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ that pass through $i$.

Example: $C_B(b) = 16$

---

# Closeness Centrality

<div style="float:right">
<img src="undirNetworkBtw.png" alt="Network betweenness example." width=400px/>  
</div>

Sometimes the most important people in a group are the ones that can reach everyone with the least effort. In these cases, **closeness** centrality measures importance as:
$$C_C(i) = \frac{n-1}{\sum_{j\neq i} dist(i,j)}$$
Where $dist(i, j)$ is the distance from $i$ to $j$ and $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. 

Example: $C_C(d)=0.75$

# Modelling social resilience online

Social resilience can be modelled as a process of how users stay active or inactive in a social networking site. 

If we consider social network users as rational, they will respond to incentives to stay active or to abandon social networks depending on **benefits and costs**.

**Benefits** can be quantified through the content users receive from their friends (shares, comments) and through the attention and support given by their friends (likes, votes).

A simple way to model monotonic benefits is proportionally to the active friends of a user $k_u$:

$$benefit_u = b * k_u$$
---

# Costs of using an online social network

<div style="float:right">
<img src="Figures/user3.jpg" alt="table flip." width=300pt/>
</div>
**Costs:** Using social network is not only benefits, there are also costs associated with being active.   
--

For example:
- Time spent to learn to use the interface of the platform  
- Risks of disclosing personal information  
- Opportunity costs: you could be doing something else  
- Economic costs, for example membership fees.

A common assumption about costs is that they are relatively similar for all users, thus modeling them as a constant $c$. Then, a user will become inactive when the total benefits are below the cost:

$$ b *k_u < c $$

# The k-core decomposition

The graph remaining after the cascade above is what is called a k-core

> **k-core**: A k-core of a graph $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph of $G$ in which all vertices have degree at least k.

For any network, you can calculate its k-core decomposition as follows:  

- Start with $k_s=1$  
- Remove all nodes with degree less than or equal to $k_s$ and their links  
- Repeat until all nodes have degree larger than $k_s$  
- Increase $k_s$ by one and repeat until no nodes are left

The nodes and the edges removed for certain of $k_s=k$ is called the **k-shell**.  
A **k-core** is the set of all k-shells with $k_s \geq k$.

---

# Coreness centrality

.center[![:scale 27%](Figures/kcore_total.png)![:scale 72%](Figures/kcore_shells.png)]

The k-shell number of a node is also called **coreness centrality**.

# Coreness and social resilience

The cost to benefit ratio $c/b$ defines a critical value of the degree $K$, below which users with degree $k_u<K$ will leave the social network. The remaining active social network is the k-core corresponding to $K$. The **cumulative density function** of coreness values in the network serves as a **resilience function**:

# Stretching the Google trends method

Data scientists at Facebook [replied to the Arxiv paper](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mike-develin/debunking-princeton/10151947421191849/) showing the problem with measuring social network use levels using Google Trends data. Applying the same methodology, Facebook researchers reached the conclusion that Princeton would lose 80% of its students by 2021:

# Stretching the Google trends method

You can even apply it to air and come to the conclusion that the atmosphere will run out of air by 2060:

# Google trends for Facebook

The Facebook examples show that decrease in search volume is a decrease in information searching about the social network, not a decrease in access and use.

# Google trends for Twitter

Twitter is not living a second growth, in fact it's growth has been rather slow to stagnant for a few years, even though it appears it is gaining users after Trump's permanent suspension.

# Temporal validity issues

</br>
A more accurate way to measure activity in a social network is Bruno Ribeiro's [approach using Alexa data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2566486.2567984), but Alexa focuses on website visits without considering access through mobile apps. 


</br>
Measurement is always an important issue in Computational Social Systems, and just because a paper used a measurement method few years ago, it does not mean it is valid today.

> **Take home message:** Your measures based on today's digital traces might not work on tomorrow's

# Summary

- Measuring importance as centrality in social networks
  - Degree: when having lots of links makes you important
  - Betweenness: when being in shorter paths makes you important
  - Closeness: When having short distances to the rest makes you important


- Social resilience as networked decisions
  - Modeling human decisions rather than disease spreading
  - A decision of a user leaving affects the situation of other users
  - This can be mapped to network metrics like coreness centrality


- Empirical analysis of online social resilience
  - Using trends as activity and sometimes social network data
  - Historical analysis of the Friendster collapse
  - Limits of Google trends: the Facebook case
