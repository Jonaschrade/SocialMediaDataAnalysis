    "#### 7.3 Openai models\n",
    "* In the following exercise we will work with the [openai API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference), an API which allows you to access very powerful AI models. Your task will be to use a [text completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/) or a [chat completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction) model to classify the sentences in `sample_with_labels.csv` according to their emotion (Sadness, Affection, Fear, Happiness, Anger).\n",
    "* You can sign up for the API by providing a phone number, and get 5 USD of free credits, which should be more than enough to complete this exercise.\n",
    "* If you use your own account, you can use any text completion/chat completion model to complete the exercise, you are also allowed to [fine-tune](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes) one of the text completion models, and use it for classification.\n",
    "* If you can't/don't want to sign up for the API, we created an API wrapper, through wich you can use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. We set a limit of 1_000_000 tokens per API key, which should be more than enough to complete the task, so feel free to experiment to find the best prompt.\n",
    "* In your `a03` folder, you can find a file named `api_key.txt`, which stores your API key you will need to use the API wrapper. ***Important: this is not a real openai API key, we use it internally in the API wrapper, to monitor usage***\n",
    "* To set up the API wrapper with the openai module, run the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "openai.api_base = 'https://smdapi-1-a6938250.deta.app'\n",
    "your_api_key = '' # your key from api_key.txt\n",
    "openai.api_key = your_api_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "* After you run this setup, you can use the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` function just like when your are using the openai module ([documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)).\n",
    "* Store the results in a column named `label_gpt`."
