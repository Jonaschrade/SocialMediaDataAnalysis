# What is social media?

Information and Communication Technologies that enable users to share content with each other and with larger audiences.

Social media are old but changed a lot recently. One example:
.center[
#### VATIAM AEDILEM FURUNCULI ROGANT
(The petty thieves ask for Vatia as aedile)

Graffito on the wall of a building in Pompeii
]

How do our social media differ from a writing on a street wall?

# What can we measure in social media?

"The idea that anything as subtle and complex as all the manifestations of changes
in temperature could be measured and quantified on a single numerical scale was
scoffed at as impossible, even by the leading philosophers of the sixteenth century." 

–Arthur Jensen, Bias in Mental Testing, 1980 

- Measuring meaning through text seemed very hard but has been improving substantially over time

- Tracking the connections between Billions of people seemed impossible and now it is a boring reality

- What now might feel subjective might be quantitative science in the future

# What can we use social media data for?

"The plan was to connect these devices to a network –it would ride on the existing
TV networks– so that the total national happiness at any moment in time could be
determined. The algedonic meter, as the device was called (from the Greek algos,
“pain,” and hedone, “pleasure”), would measure only raw pleasure-or-pain reactions
to show whether government policies were working." 

–Evgeny Morozov, The New Yorker, 2014


"More is different" 

–Paul Anderson, 1972

# What is the aim of Social Data Science?

> The aim of Social Data Science is   
**the Quantitative Understanding of Human Behavior**.  

- **Quantitative:** As opposed to qualitative or descriptive, we aim for robust findings grounded in strong evidence that can be quantified.  

- **Understanding:** Not just predicting, we want to be able to generalize and combine knowledge, and even to motivate interventions or policies.  

- **Human:**  We will not study particles or objects. Measurement validity and ethics will be a challenge.  

- **Behavior:** Observable changes, structures, dynamics, and patterns; not just stories or theories

---
#  How are we going to do it?
**Retrieving, processing, analyzing, and interpreting social media data.**

# What is data?

> **Data:** Facts in the form of stored and transmittable information.  

- *Data* is the plural of the Latin word *datum*. *Data* means ”given (things)”.  
- Data is given to us, it is not fabricated nor simulated.

**Social Data Science** is the application of Data Science to study human behavior and social interaction. 

- Importance of combining methods, synthesis, and communication
- Gathering digital traces with Computer Science techniques
- Analysis interpretation with respect to what is known in the relevant Social Sciences

**Interdisciplinarity: learning from the mistakes of one discipline to improve the others** - many examples in this course

# Why digital traces?

Data from digital traces have six properties that can complement other traditional data sources in the social sciences:

- **Big Data:** Observing large amounts of humans across demographics  

- **Fast Data:** Quantifying aspects of human behavior in real time  

- **Long Data:** Retrieving longitudinal data and at various timescales  

- **Deep Data:** Gathering persistent information on individuals  

- **Mixed Data:** Combining heterogeneous datasources and unstructured data  

- **Strange Data:** Locating small subcommunities or deviant behavior  

---

# What are the limitations of digital traces?

With the great potential of digital traces, aslo come great challenges:

- **Platform biases:** caused by their design, algorithms, social bots, etc

- **Data gatekeepers:** Not everyone can access some data sources

- **Performative behavior:** Talking online is not the same than offline.

- **Representativity issues:** Not everyone leaves digital traces. 

- **Observational data:** Testing causal mechanisms is not straightforward. 

- **The data deluge:** Too much data enables black-box predictions that can be useful but limit our understanding.

### The importance of questions in Social Data Science
