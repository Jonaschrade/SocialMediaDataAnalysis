## 2. Assortativity

## 3. Permutation tests

# Triadic closure


<div style="float:right">
<img src="closedTriad.png" alt="A strong tie." width=500pt/>
</div>

>  **Triadic closure:** The tendency of individuals in social networks to create links to neighbors at distance 2

**Local clustering coefficient**:

$$C_i = \frac{2*t(i)}{d_i *(d_i−1)}$$

- $d_{out}(i)$ is the outdegree of $i$ (>1) 
- $t(i)$ is the number of pairs of neighbors of $i$ that are connected
- can be averaged or computed globally

# The strength of weak ties

<div style="float:right">
<img src="strongTie.png" alt="A strong tie." width=400pt/>
</div>

**Strong ties:** People who are very close to you (family, friends, etc.)
- Provide reciprocal emotional support
- Long-lasting, require energy and time

**Weak ties:** People you know but not very close to you (colleagues from work, school, etc.)
- Provide information, for example about employment and housing
- Are also faster to disappear

> **The strength of weak ties:** Weak ties are weaker than strong ties, but are also many more than strong ties. (Mark Granovetter)

# Structural holes and communities

.center[![:scale 45%](structuralHole.png)![:scale 45%](ModularNetwork.png)]

## When holes are bridged: The small world concept

Small world networks have the following three properties:  
- Most nodes are not neighbors (sparse network)  
- The mean distance between two nodes is small  
- They have high global clustering coefficient

<div style="float:right">
<img src="map_us.png" alt="Milgram's experiment." width=400pt/>
</div>


**Stanley Milgram's experiment:**

- 160 people in Omaha try to reach one person in Boston by mail to their acquitances
- 44 letters reached the target with six steps on average
- Short path length as evidence of small-world
- Average path length on Facebook is 4.5

# Assortativity

.center[![:scale 30%](highDegreeAssortativity.png)  ![:scale 35%](https://dgarcia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/supports-660x661.png)]

> **Assortativity:** A network property by which similar nodes are more likely to be connected than dissimilar nodes

---

# Measuring Assortativity

Similarity is based on some node property, e.g. degree, age, political orientation, gender... 
Can be measured with the **assortativity coefficient**:

\begin{equation*}
r=\frac{\sum_c e_{cc}-\sum_c a_c b_c}{1-\sum_c a_c b_c}
\end{equation*}

- $c$ are the classes of nodes
- $e_{cd}$ is the **fraction of all edges** connecting nodes of class $c$ with nodes of class $d$
- $e_{cc}$ is the fraction of all edges connecting two nodes of class $c$
- $a_c=\sum_d e_{cd}$, and $b_c=\sum_d e_{dc}$ (endpoint class fractions)

## Homophily

![:scale 33%](homophilyToyExample2.png) ![:scale 33%](contagionToyExample.png) ![:scale 30%](confounds.png)

> **Homophily:** Phenomenon in which people are more likely to create social links to similar than to dissimilar people

---

## Social Contagion

![:scale 33%](homophilyToyExample2.png) ![:scale 33%](contagionToyExample.png) ![:scale 30%](confounds.png)

> **Social contagion:** Phenomenon in which people tend to adopt behaviors of their social contacts

---

## Confounding

![:scale 33%](homophilyToyExample2.png) ![:scale 33%](contagionToyExample.png) ![:scale 30%](confounds.png)

> **Confounding:** External effects can produce both link creation and node attributes (independent of the network topology)

## Another view on assortativity: Q-modularity

The measure of [**modularity**](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577.short) quantifies the tendency of a network to be divided in densely connected subgroups that are sparsely connected across groups.   
**Q-modularity** measures this tendency:

$$Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{u,v} [ A_{u,v} - \frac{k_u k_v}{2m} ]\delta(c_u, c_v)$$
- $u$ and $v$ are two nodes of the network. The sum goes over all pairs of nodes.
- $m$ is the number of edges  
- $A$ is the adjacency matrix ($A_{u,v} = 1$ if and only if u and v are connected)  
- $k_u$ and $k_v$ are the degrees of $u$ and $v$  
- $c_u$ is the community of $u$ and $c_v$ is the community of $v$  
- $δ(c_u,c_v)$ takes value $1$ if and only if u and v are in the same community, otherwise it's $0$

# Null models

Once we have measured something or got a statistical result from our analysis, we might ask ourselves: What is the probability that this result can appear due to chance alone? 

![](Coins.png)

- If the coin is fair: P(H) = 1/2 and P(HHHHH) = 1/32
- In the case of getting five heads, how plausible is that the coin is fair?

# Permutation tests

- Example: correlation coefficient between two variables $X$ and $Y$: $\rho(X,Y)$
- What is the probability that we could measure a similar or even stronger correlation if $X$ and $Y$ were completely independent?
- We can answer this questions with a permutation test 
- A permutation test has four components:

1. A **test statistic**,  e.g. $\rho(X,Y)$
2. A **null hypothesis**, which is a statement about the value of our test statistic when "nothing interesting happens". 
  - It is often denoted as $H_0$ and in this case it would be $H_0: \rho(X,Y)=0$.

  - It is often denoted as $H_0$ and in this case it would be $H_0: \rho(X,Y)=0$.
3. An **alternative hypothesis**, which is another statement about the value of the test statistic that stems from our theory or research question. It is often denoted as $H_1$ and, for example, it could be $H_1: \rho(X,Y)>0$. 
  - The alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis have to be contradictory. Both can't be true at the same time, but both could be false.
4. A **permutation set** with $N$ random permutations or shuffles of the data. Permutations in this set model a world in which the null hypothesis is true and any measurement different than the one specified in the null hypothesis is due to chance alone.

# Permuted data

.pull-left[
- If we shuffle one of the columns, the correlation will be close to zero, for example 0.08600673

- Idea: repeat this many times to estimate the chances of having a high correlation even though data was permuted

# The p-value of a permutation test

The p-value is a way to summarize the results of a permutation test. 

> **p-value:** Given that the null hypothesis is true, the p-value is the probability that we measure a statistic at least as extreme as the observed result

- **A common misconception is that the p-value measures the probability that the null hypothesis is true**. 

- The p-value measures the plausibility of what we measure under the null hypothesis, which is very different. 
---

# Calculating a p-value 

- *one-sided p-value*: proportion of permutations with a value of the statistic at least as large as the observed one. 
- *two-sided p-value*: proportion of permutations with an absolute value of the statistic at least as large as the observed one.


We can calculate the one-sided p-value from the permutation test:
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
p_value_Cor = (sum(corPerm>=corObserved)+1)/length(corPerm)
```
 
- We add one to the numerator to ensure we don't say zero
- The result is "significant" (p<0.05), but careful interpreting that word!
- How many times to permute: $10000$ times is safe for (p<0.05)
