## Long-term orientation and economic development
> **Long-Term Orientation (Geert Hofstede)**  
Long-term oriented societies believe that the most important events in life will occur in the future; short-term oriented societies believe that those events occurred in the past or take place now.

## Measuring the Future Orientation Index

[Pres et al. 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00350) proposed a way to measure how much a society looks towards the future with Google Trends, the Future Orientation Index (FOI). The FOI for a country *c* on year *y* is calculated as:  

.center[
$FOI_{c,y} = \frac{G(y+1,y,c)}{G(y-1,y,c)}$
]

where $G(y_1,y_2,c)$ is the Google Trends volume for searches for year $y_1$ during year $y_2$ from country $c$. 

The FOI measures the ratio of search volume from a country for next year divided by the search volume for the previous year in the same country.

# Some univariate statistics notation


- $X$ is a random variable
  - In data: $X_i$ is the value of the variable for entry $i$
  - For example the GDP of a country

- $E[X]$ is the expected value of $X$
  - We estimate the expected value as the mean of $X$: 
  $$\mu_X = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i X_i$$
  - $N$ is the number of data points, for example the number of countries

---

# Some more univariate statistics notation

- $V[X]$ is the variance of $X$
  - We calculate it as the expected squared difference to the mean X: 
  $$V[X] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i (X_i - \mu_X)^2$$
  - It is measured in squared units of $X$

- $\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation of X
  -  $\sigma_X = \sqrt{V[X]}$, which is convenient because it measures dispersion in the same units as $X$
  - in R you can calculate it with the function sd()

---

## Pearson's Correlation Coefficient $\rho(X,Y)$

> **Correlation:** Linear association or dependence between the values of variables $X$ and $Y$
 
- If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, they satisfy that the expectation of the product equals the product of expectations:  
$$E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$$  
- The principle: correlation as the deviation from $E[XY] − E [X]E[Y] = 0$  
- The absolute value of this difference can be at most $\sigma_X\sigma_Y$  
- $\rho(X,Y)$ rescales the difference to be between −1 and 1  

$$\rho(X,Y) = \frac{E[XY] − E [X]E[Y]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

Independent variables will have a correlation close to zero, but a correlation close to zero does not mean independence

## Nowcasting flu incidence with Google Trends

<div style="float:right">
<img src="GoogleFluTrends.jpg" alt="Data Science discipline Venn diagram" width="500px"/>  
</div>

**Nowcasting** is predicting the present. It provides an estimation of the value of a quantity based on signals that appear at the same time. 

Google Flu Trends aimed at nowcasting influenza-related physician visits based on Google search volumes. 

As reported in the [Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7232/full/nature07634.html), Google Flu Trends achieved a high weekly accuracy between 2003 and 2008.

The figure shows the nowcasting result of Google flu trends. CDC data is published with a delay of two weeks.

## When Google Flu Trends Stopped working

![](FluFail-crop.jpg)
During the flu season of 2012/2013 Google Flu trends started overestimating the number of cases.

# Comparing GFT with autoregression
Google flu:
$$flu_t = gft_t$$
Autoregressive model:

$$flu_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 flu_{t-2} + \beta_2 flu_{t-3} + \epsilon$$
Combined model:

$$flu_t = \beta_0 + \alpha gft_t + \beta_1 flu_{t-2} + \beta_2 flu_{t-3} + \epsilon$$
(note: More details on regression models in the next lectures)
---

# Which model is better?

- Approach 1: explained variance
  
  - Correlation coefficient between predictions and empirical values
  - Coefficient of determination $R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i \epsilon_i^2}{\sum_i(y_i - \overline y)^2}$

- Approach 2: likelihood-based metrics

  - Likelihood $\hat L$, probability of the observed data ( $x$ ) given the model and its parameter values: $\hat L = p(x | \hat \Theta, M)$ 
  - Bayesian Information Criterion: $k * ln(N) - 2 * ln(L)$, where $N$ is the number of data points and $k$ the number of parameters of the model

(note: More details on regression models in the next lectures)

# GFT versus autoregression

- Autoregressive model with two-week old data has correlation 0.86  
- GFT had 0.94, Autoregressive model with last week data has 0.95

## Algorithms and interfaces in digital traces

Algorithmic suggestions (terms to search, people to friend), shape the data and might not be possible to identify in the traces

# Big Data Hubris

.center[![:scale 60%](Hubris.png)]

Google Flu Trends is an example of **Big Data Hubris**: ”The often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis” [(Lazer et al, Science, 2014)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6176/1203)

> Take home message: **All data is better than Big Data**
